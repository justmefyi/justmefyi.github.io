"Perfect" is not so perfect.  I bought a 2-pack of these ([from here](http://www.europeanpaper.com/product/fabriano-ecoqua-perfect-bound-dot-notebook-pfa1856/)) and one arrived with the whole pad, save a single page, unglued from the cover, which told me that the glue on the margin failed.  Comparing with the intact pad, I could see that there really is only a small strip of glue along one corner of the paper pad that holds it into the cover.

The design of the cover, the feel of the notebook as a whole (cover material &amp; paper), and whiteness of the paper all met my expectations.  However, the lack of a solidly attached pad of paper has overridden any "good" that I can find in this pad.  This is a shame, since they're the only of the "premium paper" category of notebooks available with a gray cover.

Writing on it has revealed that the paper is slightly "grippier" than I'd like, but not to a degree of being "unpleasant".  The spacing of the dots, however, are much too tight for my handwriting size and will require double-spacing any writing i do on it to prevent cramping.

All-in-all, at only $10 for two it was a decent price, but with the glue on the margin failing I doubt that I'll buy again -- and cannot recommend this particular notebook.  Fabriano does offer two alternate bindings (side stapled and side spiralbound) so I might consider one of those in the future if I really absolutely _must_ have a gray cover.  But I really doubt it, the paper isn't _that_ special.
