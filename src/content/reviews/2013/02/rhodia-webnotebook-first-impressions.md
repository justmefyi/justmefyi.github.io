The look/styling of the cover, elastic strap, pages (rounded corners), and spacing of the dots (I got the "Dot Grid" version [from here](http://www.jetpens.com/Rhodia-Webnotebook-Pocket-Elastic-Closure-Black-Cover-5.5-X-8.25-96-Sheets-5-mm-Dot-Grid-Bundle-of-2/pd/8113)) all are great, as I expected. The "yellowness" of the pages was more pronounced than expected, perhaps this was from comparing side-by-side with my previous Clairefontaine "Basic" notebook that had the pure white (vs. "ivory") paper, but maybe not.

So, why'd I switch from the Clairfontaine Basic Notebook? Well, for starters I always missed some sort of closure for the notepad (either I misplaced it, it fell off due to it being loose, or I didn't get it, but there's one in the review from the [store I bought it from](http://www.gouletpens.com/Medium_Black_Clairefontaine_Clothbound_Notebook_p/c795461.htm">)). Secondly, the pocket in the back sounded like it'd be quite useful -- and better than simply sticking papers loosely into the back.

Other items I noticed right off:
* the elastic band had dented, and embossed, the cover
* the pages don't lay as flat as I'd hoped
* the feel of the cover is nice in your hands
* the cover provides a nice stable, secure, feeling when writing while holding the notepad

All-in-all, this looks like it will prove to have been a good purchase decision, even if the $38 for two sounds high.  If you're looking for paper that's a dream on which to write, look no further than Clairefontaine paper -- available in either Clairefontaine or Rhodia branded notebooks/notepads.  The smoothness, and ink-friendliness, is beyond anything that I've found.
