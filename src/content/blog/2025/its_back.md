After a multiple-year hiatis, and having to relinquish my domain due to financial reasons, I have revived this old site.

The longer-term goal is to locate all of the ancient posts (tucked away in emails and other backups) from several previous incarnations of my personal blog, but that will be a project for sometime in the future.

There may still be a few navigational issues with this site, so please bare with me as I fix things.
