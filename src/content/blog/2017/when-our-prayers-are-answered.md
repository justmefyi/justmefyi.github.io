"Where do we go when our prayers are answered and the answer is 'no'?", is what a song asks.  This is a situation that I've found myself in a few times over the last few years.

What I can tell you, is that if you are the "don't take 'no' for an answer" type of person, and continue on the same course, your life will increasingly become painful and will move further away from what you wanted until everything (it will feel that way at the time) comes crashing down upon you nearly squashing the life out of you.

If, in that time of despair, you admit to God that you were wrong and He was right and ask -- really deep down in your heart ask -- for forgiveness, then He might just grant you mercy and provide a way out.

However, if you still continue to defy Him, then don't expect things to get any better, as He will continue with the lesson until you learn.

Trust me on this:  you do not want to try to see who is more stubborn.  He will always win that title -- after all, He is forever and you aren't.

No, instead, it is just best to learn to accept "no" when received and to cry on a friend's shoulder -- or your pillow -- and then do your best to get back on with your life.

Trust that better is coming, and it will.
