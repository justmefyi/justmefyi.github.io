One of my all-time favorite movies, The Shawshank Redemption, is permeated by a theme of wrestling with hope for a better future when everything around you is telling you to give up on that hope.

This is very close to how my last couple of months have been.  Both for my professional and personal lives.  I am trying to maintain the _hope_ that I find a job soon.  I am also trying to maintain the _hope_ that my heart knows what it's doing by falling for someone half a world away.

All this wrestling with hope in my own life has my mind drifting back to Shawshank.
