Somewhere, years ago, I changed.
Not into someone I recognize.
Not into someone I expected.
Not into someone I actually like.
Does this mean I'm going to try
to change? No. But it does mean
that I'm going to try to like the
man I've become. And maybe,
along the way, I'll come to
understand exactly what caused
the changes.
