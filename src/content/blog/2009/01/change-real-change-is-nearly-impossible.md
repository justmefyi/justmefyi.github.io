No.  Make that "Difficult", not "Impossible".

Changing who we are deep down inside... Who we've been for years... Who we have grown into... is so difficult that many of us give up and claim that it's "impossible".  That's really just a way of copping out and giving up without even _trying_.  Is that really a bad thing?  Maybe.  But maybe not.  Do we need to change?  Who's making that call?

We are.

We are those that realize that we could be so much more, or have a lot better life, or be happier but we're too terrified of failure to even attempt to do anything.

I'm too picky, analytical, scared, scarred, shy, [pick your adjective].  That's why I'm in my mid-30's and _still_ single.  Oh.  Add "judgemental" and "perfectionist" to that list.  I've got this "perfect" -- let me emphasize, quote-on-quote "_perfect_" -- image in my head of what I'm looking for... even though I know -- really I do -- that she _doesn't really exist_.

How'd I get here?  How'd I get to be such a person?

I _could_ blame society.  I _could_ blame my parents.  I _could_ blame my friends.  I _could_ blame my educational or career pursuits.  I _could_ blame just about _anybody_ but the truth of the matter is that there's _only_ one person truly to blame:  _me_.

I'm the reason that I'm this way -- just like _you_ are the reason that _you_ are the way _you_ are.  If _we_ are not happy with who we are, then we only have ourselves to blame.  And _we_ are the _only_ people that can bring about change and make us into people that we'd be happy being.  No one else.  Not your friends.  Not your family.  Not your current fling or your current crush or the complete stranger you meet in line at the grocery store can make you change who you are.

They _can_ help you change though, but you _need_ to _ask_ -- _and_ they need to be _willing_.

I just don't really know _how_ to change.  Which indicates that I _really_ don't know how I want to change or who I'd rather be or what I'd change in my life -- well, other than the being single bit.  That pretty much sucks.  Sorta.  Actually, in a way it's kinda cool... but it's really getting old and boring.

I've subscribed to the philosophy that we all have "one true soulmate" for years.  The problem with that, is that there are so many people in this world that it's the proverbial "needle in a haystack".  Yet _another_ self-defeating mind trap from which we all need to escape if we're to find someone to be with.

I've been too analytical in my analysis of the whole mating rituals and patterns of humans.  Duh!  Just _look_ at how I wrote that.  Sheesh!  Anywho.  I'd basically boiled it down to this:  The _only_ reason that we date is to find someone to marry and the reason that many marriages fail is that we aren't picky enough.

So.

Here I am.

Sitting here -- alone -- typing on my computer, in my apartment, instead of being someone else and out in the "bar scene" trying to "hook up" with someone.

I'm sorry.  I just don't play that game.

Sex is _not_ the driving factor here.  It's _not_ the reason that I'm wanting to _find someone_.  I have an emptiness in my heart that'll take a very special someone to fill.  That phrase "hole in my heart" is more revealing and deeper than many (including myself for years) take it to be.  You know how those funky little screws holding your car together or the walls of your cubicle or the privacy walls surrounding that toilet you sit on at work?  The ones that have "strange" heads -- either stars or squares or some other shape.  You know the ones I'm talking about?  Well, they're "specialty screws" and used to make it more difficult for just _anyone_ to unscrew.  It takes a matching screwdriver.  Same goes with that hole in our hearts.  We all need to find that special person that exactly fits.  Of course you _could_ also use the analogy of a square peg in a round hole not fitting to explain why some people just don't "fit" together, but I like the specialty tool analogy better.  And this is _my_ blog after all.  :-)  So.  Back to those tools.  You need a certain star head screwdriver to take that headlight cover off so you can change out that burnt out bulb?  Well your neighborhood auto parts store should have plenty of them to choose from.  The point there is that whereas it's a "special" hole, there's _lots_ of tools available that'll fit it.  Just like there's lots of people out there that'll fit that hole in your heart... so stop being so damn picky and _find someone_.
