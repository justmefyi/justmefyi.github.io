Recently a photographer friend of mine, who's wanting to create a blog, asked on his Facebook page "How the $&amp;#$*! do I get started?"  Below is my advice to him, but this advice pretty well suits any business area, not just photography.  I've altered the below to be more generalized.

> On the technical side, there's many many hosting options -- odds are your hosting company might even have a quick install option for WordPress, or you could go to other hosting options such as WordPress.org, Blogger.com, or Tumblr.com, to name a few.  This site has additional info on various free blog hosting options: [http://amty.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/top-25-free-blog-hosts/](http://amty.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/top-25-free-blog-hosts/).  It's not necessarily the best list out there, but one of the first I ran across.  For more insight, search for ["free blog hosting"](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+blog+hosting).

> On the non-technical side, the key is to do what I'm not doing (lol) and write something regularly. Posts should be on topics you know, but also (if blogging to grow your business) be posts that your target audience (e.g., potential customers) would want to read. If you see your target audience as more other photographers, then write your posts based on your experiences that you wish to share -- like giving a lesson at a Super Shoots event. Mixing it up is OK, when kept to a small number of areas (again, I've failed at this over the years). Using "categories" helps, as it will provide a way to delineate between the targeted audiences' posts.

> Some strive for a post every day or two, others one a week. I don't advise to go too much beyond that as you may fall into the trap of abandoning it for months at a time (my biggest blogger failure area).
> 
> In any event, have fun at it and: _don't think too much about it_.
