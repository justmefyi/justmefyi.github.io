I started reading a (much longer than I really wanted to read) diatribe on "the American Dream" tonight and quickly stopped, because it was apparent from the author's tone that this was yet another person getting it wrong.  It's so simple, I'm amazed people have trouble figuring it out.  The American Dream is _not_ about becoming rich, successful, powerful, famous, etc., etc.

The American Dream -- the TRUE American Dream -- is the one those first few Pilgrims and settlers had:  _To be left alone!_  That's right.  Left alone!

They wanted to be able to worship -- to God -- _how_ they wanted without The Crown (aka "government") telling them how they needed to worship, lest they be locked up and have all their possessions confiscated (or worse).  They didn't care about being famous, they just wanted _to live_.

If we _all_ could get a little more in touch with history, perhaps we would _all_ be better off -- and enjoy what we already have instead of pining for celebrity status.

Stay humble, my friends!
