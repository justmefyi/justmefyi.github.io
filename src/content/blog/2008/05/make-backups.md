Ladies and gentlemen of the class of whatever.

Make backups.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, backups would be it.

Oh never mind.  I was going to do a witty little parody of this great speech that Baz Luhrmann set to music, but I'm too tired and it's too long to do a proper job, so here's the short attempt.

If you're like me, you tend to make excuses about not making backups and figure that hard drive problems won't happen to you.  Uh huh.  Yeah, right.  They happen to everyone.

Sometimes the problems are self inflicted.  Sometimes they're not.  But whatever the cause, the end result is the same:  lost data.

Here I was, smack dab in the middle of preparing a hard drive for making backups of my data when I got the "brilliant" idea to try to "adjust" the cluster size of my existing drive -- the one with all of my precious, precious data on it -- and the damn "adjustment" process died mid-stream.

If you're the queasy sort, you might want to stop reading here...

My 500GB drive had 50GB free last night.  Right now (after copying a bunch of stuff back on it from the other drive) -- after a very lengthy chkdsk process just to get the dang thing working again -- it has 210GB free.  Yep.  That's something close to 160GB, plus whatever I've already restored (probably something close to 40GB), of data that was lost.  Yep.  Nearly 200GB of data, GONE.

Maybe you'll loose data.  Maybe you won't.

But trust me on the backups.
