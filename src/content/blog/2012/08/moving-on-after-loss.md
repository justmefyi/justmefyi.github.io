Moving on with your life after loss is a very difficult task. I'm no expert at it, but I do know this: IT TAKES TIME!

Your friends family, coworkers, and others you know may be saying "just snap out of it," or other such sayings, but you need to listen to yourself and allow your body, mind, and soul to heal on their own pace.

Remember: Your loss is a wound, and wounds take time to heal. The difference between mental wounds (such as those from loss) and physical wounds (such as a severe burn) is that people never expect your physical wound to heal overnight.

For me, healing from major losses take a very long time. This year I had two major losses nearly back-to-back.

So it should not come as any surprise that I'm only now, in August, starting to feel the life return to my heart.

My new cat isn't as friendly or trusting as the one I lost earlier in the year, but he's slowly getting better with each passing week.

My ability to see "her" name mentioned somewhere and not collapse into a sobbing mess curled up in a fetal position -- even just in my mind -- has returned to me, finally. I'd still like my money back and an apology, but I know neither will happen. I also know that she'll get hers eventually. That's just how things work.

If you've had a major loss, try to remember that things will get better -- just give it time.

No sooner had I written that, but a nasty thunderstorm came through and tore the roof off the patio. Thus bringing more loss into my life. Although this loss isn't all that bad since the landlord is going to take care of it. So, I'm keeping my chin up.

You should do the same.
