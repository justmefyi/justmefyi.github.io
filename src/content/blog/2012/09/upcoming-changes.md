Change is a good thing, right? I mean, without change we'd become complacent, loose our spark, and basically loose the will to go on. Major change, however, takes that to a whole new level.

Major change has only come along a few times in my life: going to Michigan State, buying a house, and moving to Nashville. The normal sized and minor changes, such as changing jobs or moving just a few miles, have almost been too numerous to count.

I'm once again feeling a need to make a major change. Like before, I'm feeling apprehensive. However, unlike once before I'm _not_ going to rush into making _this_ change. If you've never tried finding, financing, buying, closing, and moving into a house in just half of the month of February -- in Michigan -- then you've never rushed into a major change. :-)

I had twice that amount of time when I moved to Nashville, but I still made the mistake of moving _before_ finding a job -- and it cost me... a lot.

This time around I'm going to take my time and make sure that this change (and timing) is the right thing to do. A week, or so, ago when I wrote the 1st draft of this post I said that I was thinking "8-12 months". I'm now thinking that might be a bit too much time. I just know that it won't happen until next year -- the lease isn't up until the end of the year.

What I know are these:
* I _will_ be moving to Chicago _sometime_ in 2013
* The move will cost me a job I love where I'm getting to work for someone who understands me and with really good people
* The move will cost me a bit of money
* I'll, more than likely, have to lower the amount that goes into savings each payday
* I, more than likely, won't be able to keep my grill, which really sucks because I just figured out how to perfectly do true BBQ
* I'll have to sell a lot of things (but I should've done that a long time ago)
* I'll have to start over on the ole friend-front
* I'll miss the live country music shows and songwriter nights I used to attend often
* I'll be a reducing my distance to home by half
* I'll be back in BigTen territory
* I'll be back where, when it's cold, there's snow
* I'll be next to a big ole body of water -- and my favorite one at that
* I'll be living, for the first time, in an actual "big city" (Nashville, which I _thought_ was big, isn't.)
* I won't have to pass by places which remind me of people who brought serious pain to my life and caused me an extreme amount of financial hardship on a daily basis
* I'll be able to "start over fresh"
* I'll get into better shape, from all the walking I'll have to do to get most places
