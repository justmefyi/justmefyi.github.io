Falling in love is great...
IF it's with the right person.
IF it's with someone that loves you back.
IF it's with someone that you can be with.

Falling in love is heartbreaking...
IF it's with the wrong person.
IF it's with someone that doesn't love you.
IF it's with someone that you can't be with.
IF it's with someone on the other side of the world.

Falling in love is great...
Realizing you've fallen for the wrong person isn't.
Realizing that you're falling, while falling, isn't any help...
you just keep falling and tumbling down that hill called love
building up speed as you fall
until you reach that brick wall at the bottom called heartache.

The heart doesn't listen to reason.
The heart has no memory.
The heart will love who it loves -- right or wrong.
The heart will break again and again.

My heart is breaking now...
I've fallen for the wrong person before.
I've fallen for the wrong person again.
I'll fall for the wrong person again some day.

Maybe one day it will be different.
Maybe one day I'll fall for the right person.
But until that day,
even the wrong love,
even unrequited love,
is better than no love.

My heart needs to feel "in love".
Without love...
life is...
well...
you know.

Falling in love is great,
as long as if it's with the right person.
