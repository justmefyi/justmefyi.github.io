If I had the ability...
If I had the power...
If the technology existed...
I would go back --
back in time --
and prevent the hurt,
and all the pain,
that my outbursts has caused.

I know I've hurt you.
I know I've hurt myself.
I know I can't go back...
Back to how things were...
Back to before we fought...
Back to when we were close.

If I had the ability...
If I had the power...
If I could,
I'd take all the pain away
from you,
from me.
But I can't...
And I will hurt forever,
because of that.

If I had the ability...
If I had the power...
If I could,
I'd stop myself
from loving you.
But I can't...
And I will hurt forever,
because of that.

If I had the ability...
If I had the power...
If the technology existed...
