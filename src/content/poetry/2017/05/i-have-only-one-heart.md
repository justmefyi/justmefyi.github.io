~~~~~~
I have only one heart
and that heart
has been hurt
many times
by many people
and yet
somehow
for some reason
the Good Lord kept me here
but my heart is damaged
and untrusting
and incapable of complete love
and so
I do not feel alive
not at all like I did
years ago
before the betrayals
and heartbreak
a song says "my heart will go on,"
that might be true
for me as well
but my heart
will never be the same
or whole again
because
I have only one heart
and that heart
is no longer whole.
