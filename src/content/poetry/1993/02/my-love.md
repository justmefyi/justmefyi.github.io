~~~~~~
My entire heart goes out to you my love
With a very deep affection for you
Flying in on the wings of a white dove
Against a deep backdrop of light sky blue.

I hope our future will be filled with peace
Every single day we spend together
I won't ever forget you in the least
No matter what happens in the future.

There is only one person in my thoughts
While we travel throughout our lives
We know that our love cannot be bought
No matter how many people take dives.

Only you my love will be in my mind
Whenever I get caught in a bind.
