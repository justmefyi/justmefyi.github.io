I loved you
as a friend
as a sister
and you threw it all away,
like nothing I did ever meant anything to you.
Now, here we are,
two people
hating one another,
hurting each other,
and our own selves,
wishing things could go back...
back to how they once were,
yet knowing...
knowing that is impossible
to return to those fun, happy, times
not so long ago.
