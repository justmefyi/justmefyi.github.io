My old friend, why do you hate me so?
I was always there -- a voice in the dark.
What did I do to deserve your hatred,
that you put me in that horrible position?
Why, oh why did you put me there... here?

Goodbye my old friend.
I will cherish the good times we had forever.
And will choke on the day we lost it all
until I die.
