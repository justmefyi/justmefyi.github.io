~~~~~~
I have loved deeper than I ever thought possible.
I have been hurt by the betrayal of that love.
I have given up, swearing to never love again.
Yet I have.
All of that.
Several times.
Such is life.
And, still,
deep down inside
is a yearning,
a longing,
a desire,
and the hope
that the next time --
the very next time --
that I love deeply,
will be the last time.
