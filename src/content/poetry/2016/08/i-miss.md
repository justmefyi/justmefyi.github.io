I miss
those long, deep, talks
that went on for hours
but seemed like only minutes.

I miss
that sparkle in your eyes
when we sat together
knowing we were near trusting souls.

I miss
the way I was
when I was near you
even if only on the phone
or chatting online.

I miss
all the good times we had.

But, most of all...

I miss
who you were
back when we were friends.
