Somewhere,
somehow,
I'll do what has
for many years
seemed impossible,
and forget
someone.

Sometimes,
some days,
I realize
I have a ways to go.

Sometimes,
Some days
I think
I'm there --
and then,
out of the blue,
something,
somewhere
brings it all back.

And,
just like that,
I'm back
starting to start over
once more.
