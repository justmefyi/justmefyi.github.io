I've tried to find that feeling again
I've looked at old connections
although some were half a world away.
I thought I might've found it for a while
But like a sunny day, the clouds came again.

I don't know if I'll ever find it again
the scars linger.
I'm not the same person when I felt it last.
I'm harder now.
I'm less trusting... maybe.

I don't want to give up searching
even if it means looking far away.
But for now
I'll just take each day
and hope.
Hope that someone returns that feeling
to me once again.
