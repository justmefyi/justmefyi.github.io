~~~~~~
I wish I could hear your voice,
feel my fingers in your hair,
touch your cheek,
kiss you tenderly,
passionately.

I wish there weren't miles between us
that we weren't an ocean apart
and instead we were no further
than a breath away --
embraced.

I wish my wishes would come true.
But wishes they'll remain.
Maybe forever.
Maybe not.
Hopefully not.

I wish I knew
you wished
the same
as me.
Do you?
