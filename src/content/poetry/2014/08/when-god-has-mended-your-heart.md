~~~~~~
When your emotions are torn
And true love was ripped away from you
Everything seems vile
Nothing seems trustable
Everyone seems attacking
No one seems protecting.

When everything has collapsed
And the world seems empty
And you have no safe place
Stick to your guns
Tough it out
Let time go by.

When God has mended your heart
After enough time has passed
Nothing seems wrong again
Everything seems possible
No one seems hostile
Everyone seems helpful.
