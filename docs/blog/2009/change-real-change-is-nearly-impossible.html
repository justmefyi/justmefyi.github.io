                <section class="text"><p>No.  Make that &quot;Difficult&quot;, not &quot;Impossible&quot;.</p>
<p>Changing who we are deep down inside... Who we've been for years... Who we have grown into... is so difficult that many of us give up and claim that it's &quot;impossible&quot;.  That's really just a way of copping out and giving up without even <em>trying</em>.  Is that really a bad thing?  Maybe.  But maybe not.  Do we need to change?  Who's making that call?</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>We are those that realize that we could be so much more, or have a lot better life, or be happier but we're too terrified of failure to even attempt to do anything.</p>
<p>I'm too picky, analytical, scared, scarred, shy, [pick your adjective].  That's why I'm in my mid-30's and <em>still</em> single.  Oh.  Add &quot;judgemental&quot; and &quot;perfectionist&quot; to that list.  I've got this &quot;perfect&quot; -- let me emphasize, quote-on-quote &quot;<em>perfect</em>&quot; -- image in my head of what I'm looking for... even though I know -- really I do -- that she <em>doesn't really exist</em>.</p>
<p>How'd I get here?  How'd I get to be such a person?</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> blame society.  I <em>could</em> blame my parents.  I <em>could</em> blame my friends.  I <em>could</em> blame my educational or career pursuits.  I <em>could</em> blame just about <em>anybody</em> but the truth of the matter is that there's <em>only</em> one person truly to blame:  <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>I'm the reason that I'm this way -- just like <em>you</em> are the reason that <em>you</em> are the way <em>you</em> are.  If <em>we</em> are not happy with who we are, then we only have ourselves to blame.  And <em>we</em> are the <em>only</em> people that can bring about change and make us into people that we'd be happy being.  No one else.  Not your friends.  Not your family.  Not your current fling or your current crush or the complete stranger you meet in line at the grocery store can make you change who you are.</p>
<p>They <em>can</em> help you change though, but you <em>need</em> to <em>ask</em> -- <em>and</em> they need to be <em>willing</em>.</p>
<p>I just don't really know <em>how</em> to change.  Which indicates that I <em>really</em> don't know how I want to change or who I'd rather be or what I'd change in my life -- well, other than the being single bit.  That pretty much sucks.  Sorta.  Actually, in a way it's kinda cool... but it's really getting old and boring.</p>
<p>I've subscribed to the philosophy that we all have &quot;one true soulmate&quot; for years.  The problem with that, is that there are so many people in this world that it's the proverbial &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;.  Yet <em>another</em> self-defeating mind trap from which we all need to escape if we're to find someone to be with.</p>
<p>I've been too analytical in my analysis of the whole mating rituals and patterns of humans.  Duh!  Just <em>look</em> at how I wrote that.  Sheesh!  Anywho.  I'd basically boiled it down to this:  The <em>only</em> reason that we date is to find someone to marry and the reason that many marriages fail is that we aren't picky enough.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Here I am.</p>
<p>Sitting here -- alone -- typing on my computer, in my apartment, instead of being someone else and out in the &quot;bar scene&quot; trying to &quot;hook up&quot; with someone.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.  I just don't play that game.</p>
<p>Sex is <em>not</em> the driving factor here.  It's <em>not</em> the reason that I'm wanting to <em>find someone</em>.  I have an emptiness in my heart that'll take a very special someone to fill.  That phrase &quot;hole in my heart&quot; is more revealing and deeper than many (including myself for years) take it to be.  You know how those funky little screws holding your car together or the walls of your cubicle or the privacy walls surrounding that toilet you sit on at work?  The ones that have &quot;strange&quot; heads -- either stars or squares or some other shape.  You know the ones I'm talking about?  Well, they're &quot;specialty screws&quot; and used to make it more difficult for just <em>anyone</em> to unscrew.  It takes a matching screwdriver.  Same goes with that hole in our hearts.  We all need to find that special person that exactly fits.  Of course you <em>could</em> also use the analogy of a square peg in a round hole not fitting to explain why some people just don't &quot;fit&quot; together, but I like the specialty tool analogy better.  And this is <em>my</em> blog after all.  :-)  So.  Back to those tools.  You need a certain star head screwdriver to take that headlight cover off so you can change out that burnt out bulb?  Well your neighborhood auto parts store should have plenty of them to choose from.  The point there is that whereas it's a &quot;special&quot; hole, there's <em>lots</em> of tools available that'll fit it.  Just like there's lots of people out there that'll fit that hole in your heart... so stop being so damn picky and <em>find someone</em>.</p>
